            <p>Lover is the seventh studio album by the American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift. 
                It was released on August 23, 2019, through Republic Records, 
                and is her first album after her departure from Big Machine Records,
                which resulted in a highly publicized dispute. Swift recorded Lover with 
                producers Jack Antonoff, Joel Little, Louis Bell, and Frank Dukes from November
                2018 to February 2019 following her Reputation Stadium Tour (2018) where she felt 
                motivated by the fans, helping her recover her mental health after the controversies 
                leading up to Reputation (2017). -Wikipedia.org </p>

            <h2>Lyrics:</h2>
            We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
            And this is our place, we make the rules
            And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
            Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
            Can I go where you go?
            Can we always be this close forever and ever?
            And ah, take me out, and take me home
            You're my, my, my, my
            Lover
            
            
            We could let our friends crash in the living room
            This is our place, we make the call
            And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
            I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
            Can I go where you go?
            Can we always be this close forever and ever?
            And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
            You're my, my, my, my
            Lover
            
            
            Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
            With every guitar string scar on my hand
            I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
            My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
            All's well that ends well to end up with you
            Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
            And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
            And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
            Can I go where you go?
            Can we always be this close forever and ever?
            And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
            You're my, my, my, my
            Oh, you're my, my, my, my
            Darling, you're my, my, my, my
